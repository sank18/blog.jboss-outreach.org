MY GOOGLE CODE-IN EXPERIENCE
Saniya Kolangde
Experience & Explore a world full of technology
Google Code-In has given an opportunity to all the pre-university students to indulge on an exciting technology trip where you can explore and discover new open source software development. It has various tasks ranging from Documentation to Coding and reaching beyond topics like User Interface.
It allowed me to explore interesting programmes like Turtle Art, BRL-CAD and a lot more, and how it works. It allowed me to meet various people all over the globe, in form of helpful mentors and peers.
The JBoss community can help us by introducing many more exciting tasks to complete. I would love to get on the leaderboard.
This opportunity has been given to us by Google Code-In. Every single day we are introduced to new software, new techniques and also new fundamentals of technology, alongside of being rewarded with certificates, t-shirts and hoodies, what more can a knowledge greedy student ask for. It is a great opportunity to scout and learn new things for the ones who are thirsty for technology.
